# Unit 5: Programed Solution - NEA

Investigate, design, prototype, implement, test, and evaluate a computer solution to a self-chosen problem with detailed analysis of current data processes & thorough documentation to support peer and teacher discussions.

A full system code listing will be available in the final release of this system.

## Current system

Currently the systems have been hosted on <https://solarportal.alexgs.co.uk> with the backend <https://solarportal-server.alexgs.co.uk>. This is accessible via the WWW and my setup of the system can be used.

## Setup

Alternatively in order to setup this as your own system: 
- host the provided worker.js file as an API endpoint and replace all references to solarportal-server.alexgs.co.uk with your new API endpoint
- replace all references to https://solarportal.alexgs.co.uk with the URL of wherever you have hosted your system. 
- In you attached DBMS enter the SQL setup text from the SQL.txt file provided which will initialise your database and set the relationships and also create the initial admin login details with email : alexgshijan@gmail.com , password : admin

Now your system can be fully accessible by going to where you html code has been hosted.
